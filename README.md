# Stable-Diffusion-Prompts
This example is all about giving prompts on stable diffusion in such way that it generates images, ideally according to the demand for the user 

Define the Scene: Describe the main subject or setting.

Example: "A futuristic cityscape at dusk with flying cars zooming through skyscrapers."
Include Key Details: Add elements that you want the model to focus on.

Example: "The buildings are sleek and metallic, with neon lights illuminating the streets below."
Specify Art Style or Atmosphere: Mention an artistic style, mood, or color palette.

Example: "The scene has a cyberpunk aesthetic, with glowing pink and blue lights and a dark, moody atmosphere."
Focus on Characters or Objects: If thereâ€™s a person or object, describe their appearance.

Example: "A person standing on a rooftop in a long coat, watching the city. Their hair is silver and windswept, and they wear futuristic goggles."
Lighting and Environment: Describe the lighting and environmental elements.

Example: "The sun is setting in the background, casting an orange glow across the horizon, while rain lightly falls, reflecting the neon lights."
Putting it all together, the final prompt could look like:

"A cyberpunk futuristic city at dusk with towering skyscrapers. Flying cars zoom through the streets between sleek metallic buildings illuminated by neon pink and blue lights. A silver-haired figure stands on a rooftop, wearing a long coat and futuristic goggles, watching the city below. The sun sets on the horizon, casting an orange glow, while rain reflects the neon lights."

This level of detail helps the model generate images that are closer to what the user envisions.
